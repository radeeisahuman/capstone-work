5.0/5,Highly recommended
5.0/5,"So comprehensive and complete, yet so short and sweet. I am waiting for my free pdf certificates though. 6 certificates for 12 pounds has been the best bargain I got in a while."

5.0/5,The content is good from the modules l have read.
5.0/5,Thank you so much :)
5.0/5,"The course provided a solid foundation in data analysis, visualization, and security principles. Overall, it was an informative and beneficial course for anyone looking to develop data analytics skills."
2.0/5,"The course material contains so many mistakes I struggled to focus on what I was trying to learn. Basics like keeping the narrative relevent to the titles, ensuring examples are provided, as per the words of the text (i.e. Sect 5 Para 1). The whole package needs reviewing for accuracy i.e. Six Sigma is a process improvement tool, not a quality control process, there's a difference (Sect 6 para 1.4). Very disappointed."
5.0/5,"The data analyst course was excellent, combining Python, Excel, and Power BI. Python covered data manipulation and visualisation, Excel included advanced functions and pivot tables, and Power BI brought it all together with dashboards. Perfect for beginners or upskilling, itâ€™s well-structured and highly recommended for building a strong foundation in data analytics."
5.0/5,"The Data Analyst: Data Analytics Tableau, Python, Microsoft Excel, Power BI, IT Cyber Security course was excellent, covering key tools like Tableau, Python, and Power BI with clear, engaging instruction. Practical exercises reinforced learning, and the inclusion of IT Cyber Security added valuable insights into data protection. I highly recommend this course to anyone looking to build or enhance their data analytics and visualization skills."
5.0/5,A lot of reading but very detailed and useful content. Learnt a lot from this.
1.0/5,"If I had known that this course just entails reading PDF documents, I wouldn't have signed up for it. And I would honestly like a refund cos I can't learn ""Data analytics"" by just reading documents. How am I expected to learn using these tools by looking at pictures of graphs and charts. I had to scroll through every document to see if I would see a video but no. All notes. certainly not for me please. How do I request a refund please?"
5.0/5,As a novice I found this course extremely interesting and useful. I spread it out over 3-4 days as although it is listed as just over 5 hours it was a lot to attempt to take in completely in one sitting
