# Identifying Emotional Barriers to E-Learning Using Reviews

This is my capstone project. We want to study emotional barriers to e-learning using NLP. I plan to use BERT as the primary model for the capstone project. I will decide on other major factors based on the professor's instructions.

## Why this project?

With most project ideas I have floated thus far, the main issue was data collection. Datasets in Kaggle are extremely limited. I work at an e-learning company and I know that there is a lot of data out there. I've done a lot of web scraping at work and I knew that I could collect the data with little to no cost. I could also construct the dataset that suits my needs the best.

At the same time, I also sympathize with a lot of learners who find course quality lacking or inaccessible or not up-to standards. If possible, I want to provide these people something resembling a solution. Maybe this can be a system used for course recommendations. Or perhaps the system will be used by the respective e-learning to filter poor or unfit online courses.

### Important Note

The project is currently undertaking a massive change. Around November I made some significant updates to my work without committing the changes, but I didn't want to mess with the directory structure of the project. I will be cleaning things up now. I am mentioning this so that the commits don't seem too strange.
